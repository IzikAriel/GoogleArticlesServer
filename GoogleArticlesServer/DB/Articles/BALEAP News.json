It not only brings ourfirst European Professional Issues Meeting (PIM) inLuxembourg, but also ourfirst joint conference in China, the CEAPA-BALEAP conference at the end of May (for more infor-mation, see the BALEAP events pagehttps://www.baleap.org/events).BALEAP also enters 2020 having seen a substantial rise in individual membership to 260 individual members with manyhundreds of other members included within the 105 institutional memberships. Individual memberships span the globe withmembers in 30 countries, including the UK, representing the range of contexts where EAP is taught. It is, therefore, partic-ularly pleasing that more opportunities are emerging to organise events overseas as well as in the UK.BALEAP events are nowalso more likely to be live-streamed, reaching a wider audience, and a new webinar series has beenorganised to complement the PIMs and conference so that, again, it is possible to disseminate and to discuss researchfindings,scholarship and good practice beyond the face-to face meetings","popular":18}
