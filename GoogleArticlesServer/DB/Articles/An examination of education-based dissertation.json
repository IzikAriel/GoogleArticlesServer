{"title":"An examination of education-based dissertation","author":"Tim AndersonIan AlexanderGillian Saunders","subject":"English for academic purposes","publish":"Journal of English for Academic Purposes\nVolume 45, May 2020","content":"This article describes a large-scale analysis of dissertation macrostructures in the Facultiesof Education atfive major Canadian research universities. We draw on van Dijk (1980) andPaltridge (2002) in categorizing the global organizational patterns of 1,373 PhD disserta-tions and cross reference these patterns with each studyâ€™s research perspective. Althoughprior research has addressed thesis and dissertation writing by drawing on ESP and EAPperspectives, the majority of these studies have focused on individual sections within thelarger dissertation text, while little work has considered the macrostructures of thesetexts, with some notable exceptions (e.g., Paltridge, 2002; Paltridge\u0026Starfield, 2007, 2020;Paltridge, Starfield, Ravelli,\u0026Tuckwell, 2012; Thompson, 1999). No study to date, however,has analyzed the breadth of dissertation macrostructures covered in this project. Thisresearch therefore occupies an important space in describing current trends in dissertationwriting and research approaches in contemporary educational research fromfive largeEnglish-medium Canadian universities. In so doing, we highlight not only the variety indissertation writing and doctoral research but, more specifically, the emergence of twonew hybrid dissertation macrostructures","popular":6}
