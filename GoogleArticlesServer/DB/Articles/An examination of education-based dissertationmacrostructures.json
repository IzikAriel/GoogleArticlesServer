{"title":"An examination of education-based dissertationmacrostructures","author":"Tim Anderson","subject":"Dissertation macrostructures","publish":"1/5/1969","content":"The dissertation as a means of qualifying for a PhD degree originated in Germany in the early nineteenth century with the sciences, and has traditionally been defined as a manuscript of typically 200 to 400 pages (Duke \u0026 Beck, 1999) or, according to White (2011), approximately 80,000 to 100,000 words. It is often comprised of a single study, following an “introduction, methods, results, discussion” (IMRD) structure (Duke and Beck, 1999, Paltridge, 2012). This structure is generally recommended by the multitude of guides and handbooks on the topic, but as more thesis writers turn to qualitative approaches (Paltridge \u0026 Starfield, 2007) and compete to publish their work before the completion of their degrees (Duke \u0026 Beck, 1999), a wider range of macrostructures actually occur than is suggested (and also promoted) by handbooks on the topic (Paltridge, 2002). The criteria of individual institutions for what constitutes quality in a dissertation differ, and there is no universal protocol for faculty and graduate students to follow (Foster, 2012), despite general consensus from examiner reports about what comprises both higher and lower quality dissertations","popular":2}
