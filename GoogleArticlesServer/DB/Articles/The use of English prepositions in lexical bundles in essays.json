Most prior research on prepositions has centered on prepositionalphrases (PPs), including idiomatic expressions, identified on the basis of their structureand function. This study investigates prepositions in lexical bundles, which are identifiedsolely on the basis of frequency in context and are therefore generally incomplete instructure.","popular":0}
